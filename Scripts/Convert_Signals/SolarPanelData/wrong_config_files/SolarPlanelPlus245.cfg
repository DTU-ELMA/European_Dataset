# Solar radiation below which the panel stops giving useful power
threshold=1

# A, B, C are coefficients for the equation : P= A + B*I + C*logI and
# are calculated by using the three different values of solar
# radiation and their peak powers at 25deg C module temperature for
# corresponding radiations from the data sheet
