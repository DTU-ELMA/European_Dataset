This directory defines the UK addition to the grid model.
Buses and lines are traced from the ENTSO-E map, and their reactance set by the conversion factor 0.028 Ohm/km, as originally done by Bialek.

Note, that the grid model is provided as-is, and is not guaranteed to be an accurate representation of the actual European transmission system.
